Copy this folder to /Private when you first setup the project.

The private folder is to be used for any code files you want to keep private. 

To use this folder, setup your own private repository, then create a batch file to automatically copy from that repository into this folder.

This allows you to have your own controls without them being publicly available. This folder is ignored in gitignore.
